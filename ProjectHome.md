This project delivers a novel way of visualizing and editing argument maps.

# jCollam Argument Map visualization #

jCollam is a javascript library for visualizing Argument Maps. Check the online test and manual <a href='http://collam.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/jCollam/jCollamTest.html'>here!</a>**.

jCollam has some unique argument mapping features:

  * Meta-reasoning: Quite often it is not the argument that needs to rebutted, but the reasoning instead, i.e. the link between an argument and conclusion. Argument number 14 in the picture below is an example of a such a meta-counter-argument.
  * Compound arguments: Arguments link to different aspects of a conclusion, but sometimes arguments together link to one aspect. Such a composition is either a logical 'or' or a logical 'and'. Element no. 2 is an example of an 'and'-composition.
  * Calculated probabilities (i.e. Deliberation). The probabilities of conclusions being correct are calculated by the tool, where the rule is that the probability is only 1 (i.e. correct), when all supporting arguments are correct/proven, and all counter-arguments are incorrect/unproven. One totally incorrect supporting argument or one correct counter-arguments already make the conclusion incorrect (probability 0). Such string rules forces the users to really complete the proof and rebut the rebuttals. Propositions, especially premises, i.e. leaf propositions, can have a probability value ranging from  0(false/unproven) and 1(true/proven). An example is proposition no.4 below. Connections can have strength values between -1 and 1. See connection between no. 8 and no. 10 below.
  * Coloring: Colors of propositions (i.e. arguments or conclusions) are ranged between bright blue (completely proven or true) and grey (completely unproven or false). A supporting connection is between bright green and grey, while a challenging connection is between red and grey, depending on the strength of the connection.
  * Vertical tree layout: The vertical tree layout is optimal for long sentences in arguments.
  * Argument sharing: arguments can be linked to different conclusions. The tool allows for any element to be put in the center of attention, such that it is always possible to visualize all connections to an argument.

The picture below shows an example argument map generated by the tool. The final conclusion (no. 1) has a probability value of 0.56, i.e. it has a 56% chance of being true.

# Collam Argument Map editing #
Editing features are:
  * Change tracking: changes can be tracked by everyone individually, and everyone can 'accept' changes one by one.

The editing software is not yet in a distributable state.
