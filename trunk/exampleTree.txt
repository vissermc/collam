Request for adding GOGI_OPERA_EVT_IMEUPDATE when text or caret position changes
	and
		Mouse events, USB key events, javascript, cursor keys can change caret position and text outside our local onscreen keyboard
		Text and caret position is needed for syncing with ime_update
		Ime_update is needed by 2k12 oskb text entry
			and
				We want to be able to change the text without generating a key event
					and
						In 2k12 we want to be able to update text field on the screen for each multitap event
							Expert reviews indicate people wait for the update on the screen before continuing typing, which is slow
						We don't want to trigger auto-completion while user is busy with changing the character in multitap mode
				Using ime_update is an existing method of updating text without generating key events
